The ongoing funding of the ODL will be based on a partnership model involving all the key participants (i.e. government, libraries, donors, public and private sectors). All participants (i.e. beneficiaries) are expected to make financial contributions to the ODL. It is important in achieving the full impact of the ODL on Ontario’s economy, society and learning support that all library sectors are participants (university, colleges, public libraries and schools). The proposed funding model requires a continuing government investment, but also recognizes that as the ODL matures a growing share of ODL funding will come from libraries and non-governmental sources. During the 3-year implementation phase (2004 – 2006) libraries will realign their budgets to enable ongoing funding contributions to ODL. During the same period ODL must build the proposed endowment and secure public and private sector gifts and/or in-kind contributions. The following chart outlines the model. This model is based on these assumptions: 1. that ODL expenditures will increase by 50% over a 10 year period 2. that government funding will decrease from 70% to 45% during that 10 year period 3. that library contributions, endowment and gifts/in-kind funding will increase from 30% to 55% during the same period",
